Small project to learn JAVA basics.

Each student had to choose which project he would work on during the semester.

Main tasks were:

1) To create a Java class, understand which part of a class is private and which is not. Be able to define constructors, methods and create objects.
2) To create a class hierarchy. Understand, how derived class uses the interface of base class. Know how to extend the functionality of a derived class compared to the base class. To be able to "modify" the behavior of the base class in the derived class using the method overriding.
3) Understand, be able to create and use interfaces and abstract classes.
4) Understand the use of exceptions: be able to declare, throw and catch exceptions.
5) Know how to prepare an object of your defined class for cloning. Understand the design patterns for creating objects (prototype, method-factory, abstract factory).
6) Understand, be able to create and use threads.
7) To be able to use java collections. Understand the completed semester assignment as a solution to a problem, be able to describe it.
